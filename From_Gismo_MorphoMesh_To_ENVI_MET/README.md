### Description 
This workflow let you create buildings with 3d roofs with Gismo to use in a ENVI_MET model. 3d buildings which come from OSM are made by many nested breps - in this case you could union them using Morphomesh before importing them to ENVI MET.

Requirements:
- Gismo 0.0.3 (https://github.com/stgeorges/gismo)
- MorphoMesh (https://github.com/AntonelloDN/MorphoMesh)
- Dragonfly Envimet components beta (https://github.com/AntonelloDN/df_envimet)
